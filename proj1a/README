lab1a.c:
  The source code for this lab. It creates an executable that when run,
  puts the keyboard into character-at-a-time, no-echo mode. Basically,
  what this means is it deactivates everything and is unable to backspace,
  and all input will appear on the screen (include newlines). To exit out of
  this mode, use the command ^d.

  This program also takes an option --shell. This creates two processes
  where the child process takes the form of a basic bash shell. In doing so,
  we are able to send commands into that child process and get the output
  through the usage of pipes.

  It has two different return codes:
    0: Everything ran properly, and the program was killed through ^d
    1: Something went wrong. An error message should pop up giving more details.

Makefile:
  This file allows us to more easily create an executable to run.
  It supports three options:

    make :: default make, which creates the lab1a executable
    make clean :: erases all non-integral files, i.e. everything besides
                  what's in the tar, untarred.
    make dist :: creates the tar file to be submitted, containing three files:
                 the README, the source code, and the Makefile
