-------------- Description of the Files ---------------------

lab3b.c:
  The source code that will generate the lab3b executable. This
  creates a program that requires one argument:

  [name of csv file]

  This program will read through a given EXT2_file_system summary, like
  one that we created last class. It will audit this file, and make sure
  everything is consistent. If not, it will print out a messages as
  follows:

    1.  INVALID BLOCK [B.NUM] IN INODE [I.NUM] AT OFFSET [OFFSET NUM]
          * including indirect block variants *

    2.  RESERVED BLOCK [B.NUM] IN INODE [I.NUM] AT OFFSET [OFFSET NUM]
          * including indirect block variants *

    3.  UNREFERENCED BLOCK [B.NUM]

    4.  ALLOCATED BLOCK [B.NUM] ON FREELIST

    5.  DUPLICATE BLOCK [B.NUM] IN INODE [I.NUM] AT OFFSET [OFFSET NUM]
          * including indirect block variants *

    6.  (UN)ALLOCATED INODE [I.NUM] (NOT) ON FREE LIST

    7.  INODE (I.NUM) HAS (#) LINKS BUT LINKCOUNT IS (#)

    8.  DIRECTORY INODE (I.NUM) NAME (STRING) UNALLOCATED INODE (#)

    9.  DIRECTORY INODE (I.NUM) NAME (STRING) INVALID INDOE (#)

    10. DIRECTORY INODE (I.NUM) NAME '..' LINK TO INODE (#) SHOULD BE (#)

    11. DIRECTORY INODE (I.NUM) NAME '.' LINK TO INODE (#) SHOULD BE (#)

Makefile
  This file creates the necessary executables if ran in the default
  state (make). It also supports two more options: clean (which erases
  all extraneous data from the directory), dist (which creates the tar
  file that is needed to upload).

README
  gives information about the files inside of the tar.gz file.
