-------------- Description of the Files ---------------------

lab3a.c:
  The source code that will generate the lab3a executable. This
  creates a program that requires one argument:

  [name of valid image file]

  This program will, read through a given EXT2_file_system. What it
  will do is create go through the file system, and give the following
  information:

  1.  information about the superblock in the given output:

      SUPERBLOCK,[number of blocks],[number of inodes],[block size],
      [inode size],[blocks per group],[inodes per group],[first
      unreserved inode].

  2.  infomration about the single group:

      GROUP,[group number],[total no. of blocks],[total no. of inodes],
      [no. of free blocks],[no. of free inodes],[block number of free
      block bitmap],[block no. of free inode bitmap],[block no. of
      first block of inodes].

  3.  information about free blocks:

      BFREE,[number of free block]

  4.  information about free inode:

      IFREE,[number of free inode]

  5.  information about inodes:

      INODE,[inode number],[file type],[mode],[owner],[group],
      [link count],[time of inode change],[modification time],
      [time of last access],[file size],[number of blocks],
      [block addresses]

  6.  information about directory:

      DIRENT,[parent inode],[byte offset],[inode number],[entry
      length],[name length],[name]

  7.  information about indirect block addresses

      INDIRECT,[inode no.],[level of indirection],[logical block
      offset],[block number of the indirect block],[block number].

ext2_fs.h
  gives structures that are used in the EXT2 file system, to be used
  in the c program.

Makefile
  This file creates the necessary executables if ran in the default
  state (make). It also supports two more options: clean (which erases
  all extraneous data from the directory), dist (which creates the tar
  file that is needed to upload).

README
  gives information about the files inside of the tar.gz file.
