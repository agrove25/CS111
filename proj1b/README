server.c:
  the source code that will go onto create ./lab1b-server. This file
  creates a server that creates a socket for the client to connect to
  in a given port number. It then takes the messages that the client sends
  and redirects it the pipes and into the shell (in another process). The
  output of that process is that sent to the server, and then redirected
  into the client. It is also able to encrypt information going from and
  decrypt information going to the server (if paired with the client's
  --encrypt command).

  Supports two options:
    --port=portno (mandatory)
    --encrypt=keyfile

client.c:
  the source code that will go onto create ./lab1b-client. This file creates
  a client that connects to the previously mentioned server. It then
  initializes non-canonical mode, and sends all input into the server.
  Through the polling system, it'll find when the server has sent data,
  and will take that output and display it in stdout. It is also able
  to log the data that is sent and received from the server, and also
  can encrypt information going to and decrypt information
  from the server (if paired with the server.c's --encrypt command).

  Supports three options:
    --port=portno (mandatory)
    --log=filename
    --encrypt=keyfile

my.key:
  this is a sample key that can be used for decryption and encryption.
  It just has some random text in it to use as a seed.

Makefile:
  This file creates the necessary executables if ran in the default state
  (make). It also supports two more options: clean (which erases all
  extraneous data from the directory) and dist (which creates the tar file
  that is needed to upload).
