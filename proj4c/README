-------------- Description of the Files ---------------------

lab4b_list.c:
  The source code that will generate the lab4b executable. This
  creates a program that accepts four arguments:

  --scale=[F/C]
  --period=seconds
  --log=logfile
  
  This program will utilize the BeagleBone software and sensors
  to repeatedly, every (period) seconds, read the temperature. If
  it is given a log argument, it will input that reading into the
  logfile, otherwise it will redirect it to standard output. This
  temperature reading will be in Farenheit (default), or if specified
  in the scale argument, Celsius.

  This program also has an added functionality where it can change
  its behavior while it is running. It can do one of six things:

    1.  SCALE=F   :: changes readings to farenheit
    2.  SCALE=C   :: changes readings to celsius
    3.  PERIOD=n  :: changes period to n seconds
    4.  STOP      :: pauses the readings
    5.  START     :: unpauses the readings again (every n seconds)
    6.  OFF       :: shuts the program off and logs SHUTDOWN

  Additionally, if the button is pressed (if the button is plugged
  into port GPIO_50), it will shut the program off, and log when
  it turned off.

Makefile:
  This file creates the necessary executables if ran in the default 
  state (make). It also supports four more options: clean (which erases 
  all extraneous data from the directory), dist (which creates the tar 
  file that is needed to upload), check (a smoke test to make sure the
  program can receive input).

check.sh:
  a simple test to make sure that the logfile function works and
  that we can input things while the program is running, and the
  log file will have traces of said input.

README:
